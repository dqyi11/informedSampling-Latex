\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Sampling-based motion-planning algorithms~\cite{CBHKKLT05, L06} have proven to be an effective tool at solving motion-planning problems.
They search through a continuous state space~$\calX$ by sampling random states and maintaining a discrete graph~$G$ called a \emph{roadmap}.
Vertices and edges in $G$ correspond to collision-free states and paths, respectively.

Roughly speaking, these algorithms iteratively sample new states.
This is required to ensure that, as the number of samples tends to infinity, 
(i)~a solution will be found 
(a property called \emph{probabilistic completeness})
and that
(ii)~given some optimization criteria, the quality of the solution will progressively converge to the quality of the optimal solution
(a property called \emph{asymptotic  optimality}).

Initially, 
when no path has yet to be found, 
the samples need to be drawn from the entire state space~$\calX$.
However, once a path $\gamma$ is produced,  algorithms that seek \emph{high-quality paths} can limit their sampling domain to a subset of~$\calX$ only  containing states that may produce higher-quality paths than~$\gamma$.
Following Gammell et al.~\cite{GSB14}, we call this subset the \emph{informed subset} and denote it~$\Cinf$.
\textbf{In this work we address the problem of efficiently producing samples in informed subset for systems with differential constraints}. 

For Euclidean spaces optimizing for path length, 
\Cinf can be analytically expresses as a prolate hyperspheroid and can be sampled directly~\cite{GSB14}.
Indeed, directly sampling in \Cinf has been shown to dramatically improve computation time when compared to sampling in $\calX$, especially in high dimensions. 

Unfortunately, in more general settings such as
for systems with differential constraints,
it is not clear how to directly sample \Cinf.
%
One approach to produce samples in \Cinf is via \emph{rejection sampling}---sampling a state $x \in \calX$ and testing if $x \in \Cinf$.
However, when the size of the informed space~$\Cinf$ is much smaller than entire state space~$\calX$, then this procedure may dominate the running time of the algorithm~\cite{KTC16}.
Recently, Kunz et al.~\cite{KTC16} showed, under some technical assumptions, how to efficiently produce samples in~$\Cinf$ by \emph{Hierarchical rejection sampling} (HRS). 
Here, individual dimensions are sampled recursively 
and then combined. Rejection sampling is performed for these partial samples until a suitable sample has been produced. 
%The novelty of HRS is the ability to fail fast. 

Unfortunately, both rejection sampling and HRS may produce a large number of rejected samples especially in high-dimensional spaces.
This may cause the search algorithm to spend most of its time trying to produces samples in~$\Cinf$ rather than explore it.
In this paper, we suggest an alternative approach to produce samples in the informed set \Cinf for a wide range of settings.
\textbf{Our main insight is to formulate the problem as the problem of sampling uniformly below a level set of an implicit function and then apply optimization and statistical tools.}
Specifically, our approach consists of two stages:
in the first, a random sample $x \in \calX$ is retracted to the boundary of~$\Cinf$ by running a gradient-descent algorithm;
in the second stage, this retracted sample $\tilde{x}$ is used to seed a Monte Carlo sampling chain which allows us to  produce samples that (approximately) cover~$\Cinf$  uniformly.

Our approach requires that the system has a solution to the two-point boundary value problem (2pBVP)~\cite{L06, H02} and that a gradient can be defined over the cost function.
Indeed, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a wide variety of systems and show that it enables reducing the planning time by several orders of magnitute when compared to algorithms using rejection sampling or HRS.

%While, original sampling-based algorithms such as RRT~\cite{LK01} and PRM~\cite{KSLO96} only guaranteed to asymptotically return \emph{a} solution, if one exists, they did not provide any guarantees on the \emph{quality} of the solution, given some optimization criteria.
%Karaman and Frazzoli~\cite{KF11}, presented variants of PRM and RRT, named PRM* and RRT*, respectively that were shown to produce paths who's cost converges asymptotically to the minimal-cost path.
%Additional algorithms followed, increasing the converges rate by various techniques such as lazy dynamic programming~\cite{GSB15, JSCP15}, relaxing optimality to near-optimality~\cite{DB14, SH16} and more.
%

%In the most basic form, the motion-planning problem calls for computing \emph{a} path between two given states.
%Indeed, 
%However, recent years 
%Original planners such as RRT~\cite{LK01} and PRM~\cite{KSLO96} did not provide any guarantee on the \emph{s}


\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related_work}
We start in Sec.~\ref{subsec:planning} by giving an overview of relevant sampling-based motion-planning algorithms.
We then continue in Sec.~\ref{subsec:sampling} to describe different approaches used to sample~$\calX$.
We conclude our literature review in Sec.~\ref{subsec:mcmc} with a brief overview of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

\subsection{Planning}
\label{subsec:planning}
Initial sampling-based algorithms such as RRT~\cite{LK01} and PRM~\cite{KSLO96} did not take into account the \emph{quality} of a path, given some optimization criteria, and only guaranteed to asymptotically return \emph{a} solution, if one exists.
Karaman and Frazzoli~\cite{KF11}, presented variants of PRM and RRT, named PRM* and RRT*, respectively that were shown to produce paths who's cost converges asymptotically to the minimal-cost path.
This is done by recognizing the underlying connections between stochastic sampling-based motion planning and the theory of random geometric graphs (see also~\cite{SSH16}).
Additional algorithms followed, increasing the converges rate by various techniques such as lazy dynamic programming~\cite{GSB15, JSCP15}, relaxing optimality to near-optimality~\cite{DB14, SH16} and more.


Many of the algorithms mentioned require solving a two-point boundary value problem (2pBVP) to perform exact and optimal connections between vertices in the roadmap.
For holonomic robots, these are simply straight lines in the state space, but for kinodynamic sytems with arbitrary cost functions,  computing an optimal trajectory between two states is non-trivial in general.

Xie et al.~\cite{XBPA15} use a variant of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) to solve 2pBVP and integrate it with BIT*~\cite{GSB15}.
Webb and van den Berg~\cite{WB13} use a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller to solve the 2pBVP  with respect to a cost function that allows for balancing between the duration of the trajectory and the expended control effort.
Perez et al.~\cite{PPKKL12} propose a variant of RRT* that automatically defines a distance metric and node extension method by locally linearizing
the domain dynamics and applying linear quadratic regulation (LQR).

%Finally, we note that there have been many papers presenting solutions to the 2pBVP for specific systems such as

\subsection{Sampling}
\label{subsec:sampling}
There is a rich body of literature on how to produce samples that increase the efficiency of the planner in terms of finding a solution or producing high-quality solutions.
Heuristic approaches include
sampling on the medial axis~\cite{WAS99a, WAS99b, LTA03, YDLTA14},
sampling near the boundary of the obstacles~\cite{ABDJV98, YTEA12},
resampling along a given trajectory~\cite{APD11, AS11}
and more~\cite{US03, SWT09}

Of specific interest to our work are approaches that produce samples in the informed set~\Cinf.
As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro} Gammel et al.~\cite{GSB14} describe an approach to sample uniformly in~\Cinf for the specific case of where $\calX = \R^d$ and when optimizing for path length.
To the best of our knowledge, the only method to produce samples in non-Euclidean spaces (other than rejection sampling) is HRS by Kunz et al.~\cite{KTC16}.

\subsection{MCMC}
\label{subsec:mcmc}
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)~\cite{ADDJ03} is a framework of sampling from a given probability distribution by constructing a Markov chain of random transition toward a desired distribution $ \pi (x) $.
A set of samples are generated to approximate the desired distribution $ \pi (x) $.
Unlike a rejection sampling, MCMC does a random walk in a parametric space and concentrates on an important areas, which usually brings better efficiency.
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo(HMC)~\cite{N11} is introduced to provide better efficiency in converging to a desired distribution.
It adopts physical system dynamics to propose future states in the Markov chain.
The concept origins from Hamiltonian dynamics, which models the movement of an object, the position $ x $ and the momentum $ q $ over time $ t $.
Define a system energy $ H $ of an object that consists of kinetic energy $ K $ and potential energy $ U $, which is written as $ H(x,q) = U(x) + K(q) $.
The kinetic energy $ K(q) $ is determined by the momentum $ q $ of the object, while the potential energy $ U(x) $ is determined by the position $ x $ of the object.
By the Hamiltonian equation, the movement of the object can be predicted by
$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial q} $ and $ \frac{dq}{dt} = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x} $.
This provides an approach of the gradient descent by following the decrease of an associated potential energy.
Thus, HMC simulates the Hamiltonian dynamics that moves samples towards a target distribution while avoiding random walks.

A canonical distribution bridges an energy with a probability distribution.
If two different states have the same energy, the probabilities of them are equivalent.
A set of samples from such a distribution can be equivalent to a set of samples driven by an associated energy.
By using the system energy $ H(x, q) $, we can defines a canonical distribution $ P(x, q) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp ( -H(x,q) / T ) $.
Because $ H(x,q) = U(x) + K(q) $, $ P(x, q) $ can be factorized into two independent terms, which is written as $ P(x, q) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp ( -U(x) / T) \exp (-K(q) / T) $.
The independence implies that we can sample $ [ x ,q ] $ from $ P(x, q) $ and discard the momentum $ q $ (as an auxiliary variable) in order to sample from a canonical distribution $ \propto \exp ( -U(x) / T) $.
If we have a target distribution $ \pi(x) $ of state $ x $ and define a potential energy in the form $  U(x) = - \log ( \pi(x) T ) $, we can have the canonical distribution equal to $ \pi(x) $.
The collected set of $ x $ is equivalent to sampling from $ \pi(x) $.
Thus, we can use simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics to generate a set of samples from a target distribution $ \pi (x) $.

We are going to integrate this idea into our sampling framework of efficiently generating samples under kinetic constraints. 
We define a target distribution as a uniform distribution subject to kinetic constraints and cost budgets.

\section{Motivating example---Minimal-Time Double Integrator}
We start by considering a simple yet important motion-planning problem---the double integrator.
We are given a one-dimensional point robot  with bounded velocity and bounded acceleration moving amid obstacles. We wish to compute the minimal-time trajectory between two states $x_s, x_g$.
A state in this model is described by 
the position $q \in \R$
and
the velocity $\dot{q}\in \R$ of the position
%each coordinate axis.
The dynamics of the system is described by:
$$
x = (q, \dot{q}); 
\hspace{5mm}
u = \ddot{q}.
$$
Here, the control $u \in [u_{\text{min}}, u_{\text{max}}]$ is the (bounded) acceleration. 


Notice that 
(i)~this is model can be seen as a simplified one-dimensional instance of a robot manipulator with many degrees of freedom and that
(ii)~closed form solutions exist to the 2pBVP for this specific case (as well as the generalized instance)~\cite{HN10}.

Let $T(x_1, x_2)$ denote the minimal time to move the robot from state $x_1$ to $x_2$.
Further, set
$$
T(x) = T(x_s, x) + T(x, x_g).
$$ 
Namely, $T(x)$ is the minimal time to reach the goal from the start subject to passing through the state $x$.

\subsection{Informed set}
Recall that for Euclidean spaces minimizing path length, the informed set is a prolate hyperspheroid.
Moreover, this ellipsoid is defined only be the cost $\hat{c}$ of the current best solution and not by the location of the start and goal.

For the case of a double integrator, this is not the case:
\os{show the explicit math and that it depends on the location of the start and goal}

See Fig.~\ref{fig:informed_1d_di}.

\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

Define the dynamics of a robot as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kinematics}
\dot{\bm{x}}(t) = f( \bm{x}(t) , \bm{u}(t) ), 
\end{equation}
in which $ \bm{x} \in \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n $ is the state of the robot, and $ \bm{u} \in \mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m $ is the control input.
The dynamics determines a state trajectory $ \pi $, given a duration $ T $, an initial state $ \bm{x}(0) $ and an initial input $ \bm{u}(0) $.
The cost of a trajectory $ \pi $ is defined as the accumulated cost along the path, which is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:path_cost}
c(\pi) = \int_0^{T} c( x(t), u(t) ) dt.
\end{equation}
Consider the obstacles in a workspace, we have $ \mathcal{X}_{free} \subseteq \mathcal{X} $.
Consider the bounds of the control input, we have $ \mathcal{U}_{free} \subseteq \mathcal{U} $.
The dynamics of the robot in Equation~\eqref{eq:kinematics}, free state space $  \mathcal{X}_{free} $ and free control input space $ \mathcal{U}_{free} $ determines a free trajectory space $ \Pi_{free} $, which contains all feasible trajectories $ \pi \in \Pi_{free} $.

We can define an optimal kinodynamic path-planning problem that finds a kinodynamic path minimizing the cost in Definition \ref{defn:optimal_kino_path_planning}.
\begin{defn}{ \textbf{Optimal Kinodynamic Path-Planning} }
\label{defn:optimal_kino_path_planning}
	Find an optimal path $  \pi^* $ that satisfies
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\forall t \in [0,T] $, $ \bm{x} (t) \in \mathcal{X}_{free}  $ and $ \bm{u} (t) \in \mathcal{U}_{free} $;
	\item $ \bm{x} (0) = x_{init} $, $ \bm{x} (T) = x_{goal} $, $ \bm{u} (0) = u_{init} $ and $ \bm{u} (T) = u_{goal} $; and
	\item $ \pi^* = \max_{ \pi \in \Pi_{free} } c( \pi ) $. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\dy{Do we want to set an initial and a goal for the control input? Does this simplify the problem solving?}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Uniformity}

(Give a set of parameters)
We firstly need to propose a way of measuring uniformity.
Then we can apply it to compare MCMC approach with rejection sampling and hierarchical rejection sampling.
We are interested with
\begin{itemize}
	\item asymptotic behavior (assumption: MCMC converge to a close uniformity)
	\item convergence rate (assumption: MCMC converge faster)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Efficiency}

The efficiency is shown by how the time is needed when the number of nodes are increased.
(Y: time spent) and (X: number of nodes).

\subsection{Integration}

We're going to test with RRT*, which falls into a informed RRT*.

We are going to show how the solution cost falls along time.
(Y: solution cost) and (X: time spent).

\begin{itemize}
\item DIMT (double integrator minimum time)
\item Dubins car
\item Airplane
